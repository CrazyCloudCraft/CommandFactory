# ---------------------------------- How to create a command -------------------------------
#
## Commands
# For editing commands in-game, use /eth edit
#
## Editing commands here
#
# command: '/example' - The command that gets executed when a person enters one of the aliases. You can use %player% to get the player. (required)
# aliases: '/exam' - The aliases which execute the main command (required)
# permission: 'example.use' - The permission required to execute the aliases (optional)
# permission-message: '&cNo perms!' - The message someone get if they don't have enough permissions (optional)
# executable-by: 'player' - Who can execute this command? Valid values are: 'console', 'player', 'both' (optional)
# executable-by-message: 'Silly console.' - The message someone gets if they aren't able to execute this command (optional)
# cooldown: '2d 1h 3m 10s 360ms' - The cooldown to execute this command. (optional)
# Make sure to have spaces between times. Days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds are accepted.
# cooldown-message: 'You have to wait %time% until you can do that again!' - The message if the cooldown isn't over yet. (optional)
# %time% is the time remaining and %cooldown% is the total time the cooldown lasts.
#
# If you have a long command with "", you can surround the command  with '' (hyphens), example: '/tellraw @a "hello! :)"'
#
#-------------------------------- Interchangeable arguments --------------------------------
#
# You can name an argument, like '%arg 1%', and use that in the main command.
## Example:
## command: '/tp %arg 1% ~ ~%arg 2% ~'
## aliases: '/up %arg 1% %arg 2%'
# You can also use '%player 1%' or '%whatever-1%' instead of '%arg 1%'.
# The only thing that should match with the correct position is the number.
# So '%something 1%' will always replace the first thing which it can replace in the main command.
## Example:
## command: '/test %argument 2% %argument 1%'
## aliases: '/t %arg 1% %arg 2%'
# In the main command, '%argument 2%' will be set to the value entered in '%arg 2%'
#

#
##! Be sure to use /eth reload after adding commands here to update the in-game register!
##! Overwriting plugin commands may cause issues with that plugin!
##! Cooldowns are reset on server restart!
